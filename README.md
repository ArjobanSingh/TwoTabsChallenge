# Two Tabs Challenge app

Clone the repository, and after going into root folder( which contains api, App.js etc),
run **npm install** to install all the required dependencies.
After that run **npm start** command on shell or on cmd.

This app uses Api's to fetch fake user data and images, and uses Redux to manage whole app state.
This also uses react-redux library and redux-thunk middleware.
